# Krazy Kar Projekt
The Krazy Kar Vehicle by the CREATEERS

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and the CREATEERS Club <br />
Advisor: Mr. Carlos Nodarse (BCA) <br />
Context: The CREATEERS Club, a group of non-engineering students led and taught by engineers <br />
Projekt Name: KrazyKar, from trash to treasure <br />
Start Date: January 1, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research project and its related fields of engineering. This project was made in joint with the CREATEERS Club, a club founded by myself and 3 of my friends with Mr. Carlos Nodarse, an engineering teacher at BCA. CREATEERS stands for creative engineers, a term coined by Mr. Carlos Nodarse to describe the creativity and engineering utilized to make this project possible. The aim of this club was to involve non-engineering students in basic mechanical, design, and electrical engineering by creating a custom go-kart-style one-seater vehicle for use inside and outside the school building. This project took place as a club to help teach and show previously unexposed students about engineering and the engineering process. This project was used with a $0 budget to force and nurture the recycling and reuse of otherwise "trash" materials. Everything in this project was custom fabricated, salvaged, recycled, or repurposed to serve our needs. This was quite a successful project, with many great test runs and basic testing of hauling materials in the KrazyKar. Many of the students became great friends and continued engineering projects and research, some even joining the Mechatronics Research Program at the Bergen County Academies with Mr. Carlos Nodarse. This project has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />

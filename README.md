# KrazyKar Projekt
The KrazyKar Vehicle by the CREATEERS

Researcher: Wilson Dhalwani and the CREATEERS Club <br />
Advisor: Mr. Carlos Nodarse (BCA) <br />
Context: The CREATEERS Club, a group of non engineering students lead and taught by engineers <br />
Projekt Name: KrazyKar: From Trash to Treasure <br />
Start Date: January 1, 2022 <br />

The following repository is for documenting and sharing my work in this research projekt and its related fields of engineering. This projekt was made in joint with the CREATEERS Club, a club founded by myself and 3 of my friends with Mr. Carlos Nodarse, an engineering teacher at BCA. CREATEERS stands for creative engineers, a term coinded by Mr. Carlos Nodarse to describe the creativty and engineering utilized to make this projekt possible. The aim of this club was to involve non-engineering students into basic mechanical, design, and electrical engineering by creating a custom go-kart style one seater vehicle for use inside and outside the school building. This projekt took place as a club to help teach and show previously unexposed students to engineering and the engineering process. This projekt was used with a $0 budget to force and nurture recycling and reuse of otherwise "trash" materials. Eveyrthing in this projekt was custom fabricated, salvaged, recycled, or repurposed to serve our needs. This was quite a successful projekt, with many great tests runs and basic testing of hauling materials in the KrazyKar. Many of the students became great friends and continued engineering porjekts and research, some even joining the Mechatronics Research Program at the Bergen County Academies with Mr. Carlos Nodarse. This projekt has no end date as innovation never ends, rather, continues until the idea is forgotten, and my hope is that this work can be the basis for future engineers who, too, find great excitement in innovation and design. <br />
